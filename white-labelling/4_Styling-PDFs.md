# Styling PDF output

There are several dimenisons in which we can configure the PDF output.

* Changing the assets (images and fonts)
* Changing the final page context 
* Updating the code directly

All of the base files are in the `Choices.PDF` project. Which is part of the [choices_api repository](https://github.com/Compassion-in-Dying/choices_api/tree/main/src/api/Choices.PDF)

Changing the assets and or the code is simply a case of making the desired changes to the files and then redeploying the API through which ever means you have decided on for your organisation. 

> Note: If you linking directly to the compassion in dying website then this type of customisation is not possible.
